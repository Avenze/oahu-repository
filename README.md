# Welcome to the Oahu repository!

Hi there! This document was written by Avenze, and it guides you trough what this repository is used for, and how to use it! We use GitHub for issue management and project management!

# Oahu

Oahu is a roleplaying game, based on the Roblox Engine, we're trying to innovate as many unique features as possible, and add them to Oahu, and if you find any issues with them, contact an support team member, and they'll add it to the GitHub issues page.

# Social Media Platforms

We use multiple social media platforms, but the main one is of course [Discord](https://discord.com/7FbEQZQ), we do not have any official Twitter, Instagram, and so on, accounts, but in the near future, we're planning on creating a Twitter account for the development of Oahu.
