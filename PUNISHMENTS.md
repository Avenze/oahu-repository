# Welcome to the Oahu Punishment documentation file!

This document was written by Avenze, I'm going to document every possible reason to why you were/can be kicked/banned from Oahu. There are always 2 characters in front of the identifying number, the 2 characters can mean:

- NP : No Permission
- NE : Non Existant
- IA : Invalid Arguments
- UA : Unauthorized Action

Often, if you were kicked with the 2 characters being IA or UA, you were most likely kicked for exploiting

# NP Documentation

- NP01 : You were kicked/banned for attempting to edit values of a vehicle that you do not own, neither are driving at that time.
- NP02 : You attempted to spawn a vehicle that you do not own, the vehiclemenu only shows purchased vehicles.
- NP03 : You attempted to run the generatevehicles command without proper permissions being configured for you in the configurationdatatable.
- NP04 : The player attempted to purchase a vehicle that they already own, this is already sort of prevented in the InterfaceController, exploiter lmao

# NE Documentation

- NE01 : The vehicle that the player requested to spawn/purchase does not exist in the Vehicles folder in ReplicatedStorage.

# IA Documentation

- IA01 : The RemoteFunction that the player attempted to fire detected invalid arguments that were passed from the player.

# UA Documentation
